                        <li>WeTrade is a web 
                            application that allows users to simulate the 
                            trading of stocks on NYSE and NASDAQ in real 
                            time</li>

                            started as a project for a databases class and has 
                            slowly been polished over the last few months to the 
                            minimum viable stage it's in right now.</li>
                        <li>WeTrade is developed fully by me, a recent computer 
                            science grad from the College of Charleston. I had 
                            recently became interested in trading stock and I wanted
                            to integrate my skill base with the financial sector.

                 <li>How safe is this application?/Why should I trust you with my email/password?
                    <ul>
                        <li>I've taken every precaution that I know of to secure
                            this application. Total security is impossible to 
                            achieve; subsequently security only exists in layers of protection.
                            This application uses encrypted transport to protect
                            against man in the middle attacks. Password are 
                            stored hashed and salted in our database using an 
                            algorithm that exceeds industry strength. All database 
                            calls are protected from DDL injection. Even if the 
                            database were to be compromised, an attacker would 
                            only have access to emails, names, account balances, and holdings.
                            In this case only accounts with very weak passwords could be compromised.
                            
                           
                            </li>
                        <li>This application is hosted on AWS infrastructure to 
                            prevent any hardware security issues.
                            </li>
